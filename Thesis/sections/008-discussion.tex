\section{Discussion}

Here you present the interpretation of the results and assess their significance. Discuss possible implications of the results, and offer possible recommendations. You must report on whether you have achieved the objectives you set out, answering your research question and achieving the aim of your work. The section should also include reflections on the job and its limitations.  You can also discuss solutions to problems that you have identified and discussed earlier or address other issues that the work did not address, questions that were not answered. Also, link your findings to previous work. This way, the discussion can become a conversation with what you wrote in the last section.  Finally, put your work in a broader context, and broaden your perspective. Can your results be generalised? Can what you have done be used in some other context?
