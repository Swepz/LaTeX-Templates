\section{Method} 
\label{sec:method}

In this section you should describe the scientific methods you have used and how you have approached the work itself. For each objective above, identify a method for achieving the objective. The choice of method should be justified. For example, you may have made a mathematical model, used simulations, made an implementation that you tested, or done experiments that you may have evaluated using statistical methods. In the first instance, you should describe the scientific methods you used, but it is also useful to describe how you worked on the task. The Methods section also answers why you did a certain way or why you used a certain tool. So you should not only describe the "what" but also the "why". Ask yourself: can the chosen method help me to achieve the set objectives and thus answer the research question?

Choosing the right scientific method(s) is important for you to achieve your goals \cite{researchmethodology,forskningsmetodik}, so this is a point that you should discuss with your supervisor at an early stage. Also, search the literature for good descriptions of methods, and how best to write a Methods section.
