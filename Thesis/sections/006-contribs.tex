\section{Description of the work}

After the sections above, there is a description of what you have done. It would help if you did not use the heading above but replaced it with appropriate titles, depending on your work. The structure should be made clear by the section headings. Having a clear, logical structure and a narrative flow is essential. You should include the advanced background knowledge necessary to understand how you solved the assignment and define hypotheses and critical concepts. The description of experiments should be such that it is possible to repeat them. If such a description is very long and detailed, you can put it in an appendix. See below.
