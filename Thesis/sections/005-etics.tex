\section{Ethical and Societal Considerations}

In the first instance, "ethics" refers to research ethics issues. Does your choice of research question or method imply any research ethics position? For example, if you are interviewing people for your work, can you guarantee their anonymity, and how will you use the information you get from them? Are there other ethical aspects to consider in your career? Might there be ethical aspects to the outcome of your job? You should indicate if you believe that your work does not contain any research ethics issues. 

You should also critically review and analyse your work concerning societal aspects. For example, you could discuss how your work relates to economic, social and environmental sustainability objectives. There may also be legal and political aspects to your work.
