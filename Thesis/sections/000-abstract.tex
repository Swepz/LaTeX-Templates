% ============================= Abstract ==============================
\begin{abstract}
    This section will simply be that: a summary of the whole report. An appropriate length is about 200 - 250 words.  A good rule of thumb is to keep the abstract as short as possible, it should be compact but still clear, informative and arouse interest. Give the main facts
    and summarise everything that is essential in the report.  The following should be included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Presentation/introduction of the field of work
    \item[--] outline of the task including purpose and questions
    \item[--] Motivation why the area and the task are important and interesting
    \item[--] General description of how you have approached the task, what you have done
    \item[--] Summary of results and conclusions and the contribution of your work
    \end{itemize}
    
    No details should be included in the summary, nor a description of how the report is structured. 
    The summary should be read independently of the rest of the report, and by a fairly wide range of readers. It should provide a good basis for a reader to judge whether they are interested in reading the whole report. 
    The executive summary is the part of a report that is read the most and by the most people. It is therefore particularly important to write a good executive summary. You need to have a firm grasp of the content of the report when writing the executive summary, and once the full report is complete, you should review and, if necessary, revise the executive summary to make it consistent with the report.
